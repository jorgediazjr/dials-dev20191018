To compile DIALS you need to run

  python bootstrap.py --builder=dials base

which will install python and third party python packages to the directory 'base',
followed by

  python bootstrap.py --builder=dials build

to configure and compile DIALS and cctbx.
Alternatively you can also run 

  make

to the same effect


Once built you can load DIALS by running

  . build/setpaths.sh


If you encounter any errors running the bootstrap script, try adding the parameter '-v' to get more verbose output.
