Processing in Detail with DUI
=============================

.. highlight:: none

Introduction
------------

This tutorial follows the same steps as the command line tutorial
:doc:`processing_in_detail_betalactamase`, but here processing will be driven
graphically through the DIALS User Interface, DUI_.

.. _DUI: https://github.com/ccp4/DUI

DUI is part of CCP4 and can be launched from ccp4i2 by selecting the relevant
icon from within the "Integrate X-ray images" task folder.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/ccp4i2_dui.png

Tutorial data
-------------

The following example uses a Beta-Lactamase dataset collected using
beamline I04 at Diamond Light Source, and reprocessed especially for
these tutorials.

..  hint::
    If you are physically at Diamond on the CCP4 Workshop, then
    this data is already available in your training data area. After
    typing :samp:`module load ccp4-workshop` you'll be moved to a working
    folder, with the data already located in the :samp:`tutorial-data/summed`
    subdirectory.

The data is otherwise available for download from |lactamase|.
We'll only be using the first run of data in this tutorial,
:samp:`C2sum_1.tar`, extracted to a :samp:`tutorial-data/summed` subdirectory.

.. |lactamase|  image::  https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1014387.svg
                :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1014387

Import
^^^^^^

When DUI starts up you will initially be presented by a window like the
following.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/dui_empty.png

At this stage you can resize various parts of the interface until you are
comfortable with the layout, but you can't do much else until the dataset is
imported by DIALS. To do this, click on the "Select File(s)" button, navigate
to the location of the images and select any one of them. DUI will automatically
determine the filename template and will show that with a wildcard in the text
box. If there are problems with this template it is possible to edit this before
importing the images. Otherwise, just click the "Run" button to proceed.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/import.png

What happens then is that that the metadata are read for all the
images in the dataset. If these are consistent, then the dataset is imported
and initial models for the "Beam", "Scan" and "Detector" are created. The images
are now also displayed within the "Image View" tab. You can adjust the contrast
and colour scheme by controls under the "Palette Tuning" pull-down.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/image_view_palette.png

Find Spots
^^^^^^^^^^

The first "real" task in any processing using DIALS is the spot finding. To run
this job, click on the "find" button at the upper-left of the window. When you
do this you will see a new node will be created in the "History Tree". This node
is currently green, which indicates that it has not been run yet. By contrast,
the import step is blue, which means this has been run. In general, it is always
possible to navigate between each step of processing by clicking on the relevant
position in the history. Advanced users will find this gives a great deal of
control, allowing them to keep track of complex history, including parallel
branches.

Spot-finding, like most of the other processing steps in DUI, presents user
parameters at two levels of detail. The "Simple" tab contains the basic
parameters that are the most commonly changed. The "Advanced" tab contains
all of those again, plus other parameters that may be required for expert use
with challenging data sets. In many cases, however, the default settings are
fine.

Note that spot-finding is done on every image in the dataset. This means the
job can take some time, but by default it will be run in parallel using
multiple processors. To proceed, press the "Run" button below the input
parameters.

Once the job is finished, the image viewer will display small green boxes
around the pixels that have been marked as strong. It is also useful to click
on the "Report View" tab and scroll down to the "Analysis of strong reflections".
This shows a graph of the number of strong spots found per image. In this case
there is a pretty steady rate of around 150 spots found on each image. If
instead we had seen the number of strong spots drop off over the dataset, or
otherwise show large variability we would start to worry about issues such
as radiation damage or a poorly-centred crystal.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/report_spot_count.png

The cyan button at the bottom left of the graph opens a help window with a
description of how the appearance of this plot may be affected by various
data collection issues. In the "Log Text" window you can see the text output
from the :doc:`dials.find_spots<../programs/dials_find_spots>` program, which
also includes an ASCII-art version of this plot.

The default parameters for spot finding usually do a good job for Pilatus
images, such as these. However they may not be optimal for data from other
detector types, such as CCDs or image plates. If you have a case where
spot-finding has gone badly, it may be helpful to debug using the
:doc:`dials.image_viewer<../programs/dials_image_viewer>` and
:doc:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer<../programs/dials_reciprocal_lattice_viewer>`,
which can be launched via buttons shown on the "External Tools" tab.

In particular, the effect of changing the spot-finding parameters can be explored
interactively with the :doc:`dials.image_viewer<../programs/dials_image_viewer>`.
The image mode buttons at the bottom of the "Settings" window allow a preview
of how the parameters affect the spot finding algorithm. The final image,
("threshold") is the one on which spots were found, so ensuring this produces
peaks at real diffraction spot positions will give the best chance of success.

The second external viewer, the :doc:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer<../programs/dials_reciprocal_lattice_viewer>`,
displays the strong spots in 3D, after mapping them from their detector
positions to reciprocal space. In a favourable case you should be
able to see the crystal's reciprocal lattice by eye in the strong spot
positions. Some practice may be needed in rotating the lattice to an
orientation that shows off the periodicity in reciprocal lattice positions.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase/reciprocal_lattice_strong.png

Although the reciprocal spacing is visible, in this data, there are clearly
some systematic distortions. These will be solved during indexing.

Indexing
^^^^^^^^

The next step will be indexing of the strong spots. Click on the "Index" button
to move on to this step, and form a new node in the history tree. Here we see
that the simple parameters allow only to select between different "Indexing
Methods", the default of which is the 3D FFT algorithm. The other options are
the 1D FFT (DPS) algorithm and a special version of the 3D FFT called
:samp:`real_space_grid_search`, which is particularly useful for narrow wedges
containing multiple lattices, but requires a known cell and space group to be
set under the "Advanced" parameters. If we do know the cell and space group,
these can also be set as hints for either of the other two indexing algorithms.
This can help in difficult cases and will be used to constrain the lattice
during refinement. Otherwise
indexing and refinement will be carried out in the primitive lattice
using space group P1.

In this case, keep the method set to the default :samp:`fft3d` and click "Run" to
start the indexing job. Once the job has finished running, you will see that
the experimental models have now been completed with a "Crystal" model.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/status_after_index.png

Now let's click through the tabs of output. First, on the image viewer you will
now see that indexed strong spots are assigned Miller indices. If you also
click on the "Predictions" checkbox, under "Reflection Type" you will in
addition see centroid positions and Miller indices for all predicted
reflections, not just the strong spots.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/image_view_predictions.png

Moving to the "Log Text" tab, it is worth reading through the output to
understand what the indexing program has done. Inspecting the beginning of the
log shows that the indexing step is done at a resolution lower than the full
dataset; 1.84 Å:

.. dials_tutorial_include:: betalactamase/dials.index.log
    :start-at: Found max_cell
    :lines: 1-3

The resolution limit of data that can be used in indexing is determined
by the size of the 3D FFT grid, and the likely maximum cell dimension.
Here we used the default 256³ grid points. These are used to make
an initial estimate for the unit cell parameters.

What then follows are 'macro-cycles' of refinement where the experimental model
is first tuned to get the best possible fit from the data, and then the
resolution limit is reduced to cover more data than the previous cycle. 16
parameters of the diffraction geometry are tuned: 6 for the detector, one for
beam angle, 3 crystal orientation angles and the 6 triclinic cell parameters.
At each stage only 36000 reflections are used in the refinement job. In order
to save time, a subset of the input reflections are used - by default using 100
reflections for every degree of the 360° scan.

We see that the first macrocycle of refinement makes a big improvement in
the positional RMSDs:

.. dials_tutorial_include:: betalactamase/dials.index.log
   :start-after: Refinement steps
   :end-before: RMSD no longer decreasing

Second and subsequent macrocycles are refined using the same number of
reflections, but after extending to higher resolution. The RMSDs at the
start of each cycle start off worse than at the end of the previous
cycle, because the best fit model for lower resolution data is being
applied to higher resolution reflections. As long as each macrocyle
shows a reduction in RMSDs then refinement is doing its job of extending
the applicability of the model out to a new resolution limit, until
eventually the highest resolution strong spots have been included. The
final macrocycle includes data out to 1.30 Å and produces a final model
with RMSDs of 0.050 mm in X, 0.049 mm in Y and 0.104° in φ,
corresponding to 0.29 pixels in X, 0.28 pixels in Y and 0.21 image
widths in φ.

Despite the high quality of this data, we notice from the log that at each
macrocycle there were some outliers identified and removed from
refinement as resolution increases. Large outliers can dominate refinement
using a least squares target, so it is important to be able to remove these.
More about this is discussed below in :ref:`detailbetal-sec-refinement`.
It's also worth checking the total number of reflections that were unable to
be assigned an index:

.. dials_tutorial_include:: betalactamase/dials.index.log.extract_unindexed
   :start-after: [START_EXTRACT]
   :end-before:  [END_EXTRACT]

because this can be an indication of poor data quality or a sign that more
care needs to be taken in selecting the indexing parameters.

Now the "Report View" contains more information than just after spot-finding.
The "Spot count per image" plot also contains information about the number
of indexed spots. In addition there are heat maps giving information about the
positions of indexed and unindexed spots. Here we see that most of the unindexed
spots are found in the region around the rotation axis. The "Analysis of reflection
centroids" plots provide lots of detail regarding how well the predicted spot
positions match the observed positions, both in image space and as a function of
the position within the rotation scan.

After indexing it can be useful to inspect the reciprocal lattice again under
the "External Tools". Now indexed/unindexed spots are differentiated by colour,
and it is possible to see which spots were marked by :doc:`dials.refine
<../programs/dials_refine>` as outliers. If you have a dataset with multiple
lattices present, it may be possible to spot them in the unindexed reflections.

In this case, we can see that the refinement has clearly resolved whatever
systematic error was causing distortions in the reciprocal space view, and the
determined reciprocal unit cell fits the data well:

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase/reciprocal_lattice_indexed.png

Bravais Lattice Refinement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since we didn't know the Bravais lattice before indexing, we can now determine
likely candidates - by taking the results of the P1 autoindexing, and running
refinement with all of the possible Bravais settings applied. You can then
choose your preferred solution. This step is accessed by the "Lattice" button
on the left of the DUI window. As before, run this without altering any of
the defaults, as they are suitable for the majority of data sets.

Once the job has run, a window will pop up containing scoring data and the unit
cell for each Bravais setting.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/reindex_table.png

The scores for each setting include max δ (a metric fit measured in degrees),
RMSDs (in mm), and the best and worse correlation coefficients for data related
by symmetry elements (the symmetry elements implied by the lowest symmetry
space group from the Bravais setting). This uses the raw spot intensity
measurement from the spot-finding procedure (uncorrected and unscaled) but
provides a very useful check to see if the data does appear to adhere to the
proposed symmetry operators.

DIALS uses an heuristic to determine which solutions are acceptable or not,
indicated on this window by either a green highlighted "Y" or a red highlighted
"N". In addition, the single "best" solution (the highest symmetry of the
acceptable results) is pre-selected (highlighted in blue). To pick this
solution, simply click "OK" while the chosen solution is highlighted. This will
automatically apply the symmetry constraints and will reindex the reflections
ready for further refinement.

Refinement
^^^^^^^^^^

The model is already refined during indexing, but we can also add explicit
refinement steps here. This is beneficial because it will use all reflections in
refinement rather than a subset, uses a more sophisticated outlier rejection
algorithm and will later allow us to fit a scan-varying model of the crystal.

We start by refining a static model including the monoclinic constraints from
our chosen reindexed solution. For this we leave "Scan Varying Refinement" as
"False". There are various choices of outlier rejection algorithm allowed by
refinement. The default selection of "auto" will choose the "mcd" algorithm
for a rotation scan like this, which performs outlier rejection on the X, Y and
φ residuals simultaneously, taking into account the multivariate nature of the
data. This is appropriate for the 'polishing up' stage of refinement, whereas
before during indexing the rougher, but less computationally expensive "tukey"
option was used instead.

As before, click "Run" to start the job. The "Log Text" is familiar from the
indexing stage. We see that all strong reflections were used in refinement,
providing a small reduction in RMSDs. However, the refined model is still
static over the whole dataset. We would like to do an additional refinement job
at this point, to fit a more sophisticated model for the crystal, allowing
small misset rotations to occur over the course of the scan. There are usually
even small changes to the cell dimensions (typically resulting in a net
increase in cell volume) caused by exposure to radiation during data
collection. To account for both of these effects we can extend our
parameterisation to obtain a smoothed *scan-varying* model for both the crystal
orientation and unit cell.

This means running a further refinement job starting
from the output of the previous job. To do that, note that the current "refine"
node is a completed job and the parameters we entered are now greyed-out and
cannot be edited. To do a second refinement starting from this point we simply
click on the "refine" button again, opening a new green node in the history
tree. Here we can select "Scan Varying Refinement" as "True" and click "Run"
again to start the job.

The log output shows a decrease in each dimension, but especially in Y.

.. dials_tutorial_include:: betalactamase/dials.sv_refine.log
   :start-after: Refinement steps
   :end-before: RMSD no longer decreasing

The final RMSDs are less than a quarter of a pixel in both X and Y, and just
under a fifth of a pixel in φ. This is about as good as we can expect from
a high quality Pilatus data set such as this.

In the "Report View" we can now see plots of how the cell and orientation
changes during the scan. The smoothness of these plots is guaranteed by the
smoother model used by :doc:`dials.refine<../programs/dials_refine>`. However,
we are satisfied that this model is sufficient to match real changes present
in the dataset because of the very low overall RMSDs.

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase/scan_varying.png

Other useful plots in the report are:

* **Difference between observed and calculated centroids vs phi**,
  which shows how the average
  residuals in each of X, Y, and φ vary as a fuction of φ.
  If scan-varying refinement has been successful in capturing the real changes
  during the scan then we would expect these plots to be straight lines.

* **Centroid residuals in X and Y**, in which the X, Y residuals are shown
  directly. The key point here is to look for a globular shape centred at the origin.

* **Difference between observed and calculated centroids in X and Y**,
  which show the difference between predicted and observed reflection positions
  in either X or Y as functions of detector position. From these plots it is very
  easy to see whole tiles that are worse than their neighbours, and whether
  those tiles might be simply shifted or slightly rotated compared to the model
  detector.

In this tutorial, we see no overall increase in all three cell parameters. If
significant cell volume increases had been observed that might be indicative of
radiation damage. However we can't yet conclude that there is *no* radiation
damage from the *lack* of considerable change observed.

Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^

After the refinement is done the next step is integration. Click on the
"integrate" button to move to this job. Mostly,
the default parameters are fine for Pilatus data, which will perform
XDS-like 3D profile fitting while using a generalized linear model in order
to fit a Poisson-distributed background model. As with spot-finding, the
number of processes can be set >1 to speed the job up (but DUI will have
selected a suitable default). Click "Run" to start integration. This is the
most computationally-demanding stage of processing, so it will take a while to
complete.

Checking the "Log Text" output, we see that after loading in the reference
reflections, new predictions are made up to the highest resolution at the
corner of the detector. This is fine, but if we wanted to we could have
adjusted the resolution limits using parameters :samp:`d_min` and :samp:`d_max`
under :samp:`prediction` in the "Advanced" parameters tab. The predictions are
made using the scan-varying crystal model from the previous step. As this
scan-varying model was determined in advance of integration, each of the
integration jobs is independent and we can take advantage of true parallelism
during processing.

The profile model is then calculated from the reflections file resulting from
refinement. First reflections with a too small 'zeta' factor are filtered out.
This essentially removes reflections that are too close to the spindle axis. In
general these reflections require significant Lorentz corrections and as a
result have less trustworthy intensities anyway. From the remaining reflection
shoeboxes, the average beam divergence and reflecting range is calculated,
providing the two Gaussian width parameters :math:`\sigma_D` and
:math:`\sigma_M` used in the 3D profile model.

Following this, independent integration jobs are set up. These jobs
overlap, so reflections are assigned to one or more jobs. What follows are
blocks of information specific to each integration job.

After these jobs are finished, the reflections are 'post-processed', which
includes the application of the LP correction to the intensities. Then
summary tables are printed giving quality statistics first by frame, and
then by resolution bin.

On the "Image View" tab we can now see integration "shoeboxes" around the spots,
not just tight boxes around the strong pixels. If all stages up to this point
have gone well, then the boxes should be centred on the strong pixels and should
extend beyond the strong pixels to include pixels used for local background level
determination.

The "Report View" now contains additional plots under the "Analysis of
reflection intensities" and "Analysis of reference profiles" sections. It is
worth checking through these, particularly paying attention to the following:

* **Reflection and reference correlations binned in X/Y**.
  These are useful companions to the
  plots of centroid residual as a function of detector position above.
  Whereas the above plots show systematic errors in the positions and
  orientations of tiles of a multi-panel detector, these plots indicate what
  effect that (and any other position-specific systematic error) has on the
  integrated data quality. The first of these plots shows the correlation
  between reflections and their reference profiles for all reflections in the
  dataset. The second shows only the correlations between the strong reference
  reflections and their profiles (thus these are expected to be higher and do
  not extend to such high resolution).

* **Distribution of I/Sigma vs Z**. This reproduces the
  :math:`\frac{I}{\sigma_I}` information versus frame number given in the log
  file in a graphical form. Here we see that :math:`\frac{I}{\sigma_I}` is fairly
  flat over the whole dataset, which we might use as an indication that there
  were no bad frames, not much radiation damage occurred and that scale factors
  are likely to be fairly uniform.

At this point we could export the integrated data set in MTZ format, however
we will continue with this tutorial to demonstrate scaling within DIALS.

Checking the symmetry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After integration we can return to our hypothesis of the space group of the
crystal. Although we made an assessment of that when we chose a Bravais lattice
after indexing, we now have better, background-subtracted, values for the
intensities, and for all reflections, not just the strong spots. So, it is
prudent to repeat the assessment to see if there is any indication that our
initial assessment should be revised.

This job is run using the "symmetry" button. We will again run with default
settings only. Once the job is finished, check the "Log Text" output. The most
important part here is the table printed at the end::

  Scoring all possible sub-groups
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Patterson group       Likelihood  NetZcc  Zcc+   Zcc-   CC     CC-    delta  Reindex operator

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Best solution: C 1 2/m 1

Here we see clearly that the best solution is given by :samp:`C 1 2/m 1`, with
a high likelihood, in agreement with the result from
:samp:`dials.refine_bravais_settings`. As we remain confident with this choice,
we now continue to scaling.

Scaling
^^^^^^^

Before the data can be reduced for structure solution, the intensity values must be corrected for
experimental effects which occur prior to the reflection being measured on the
detector. These primarily include sample illumination/absorption effects
and radiation damage, which result in symmetry-equivalent reflections having
unequal measured intensities (i.e. a systematic effect in addition to any
variance due to counting statistics). Thus the purpose of scaling is to determine
a scale factor to apply to each reflection, such that the scaled intensities are
representative of the 'true' scattering intensity from the contents of the unit
cell.

During scaling, a scaling model is created, from which we derive scale factors for
each reflection. By default, three components are used to create a physical model
for scaling (:samp:`model=physical`), in a similar manner to that used in the
program aimless_. This model consists of a smoothly varying scale factor as a
function of rotation angle, a smoothly varying B-factor to
account for radiation damage as a function of rotation angle
and an absorption surface correction, dependent on the direction of the incoming
and scattered beam vector relative to the crystal.

Let's scale the Beta-lactamase dataset, after setting a resolution cutoff (`d_min`)
of 1.4. This job is created by clicking the "scale" button. Enter 1.4 in the
`d_min` field in the "simple" tab and click "Run" to start the job.

As can be seen from the "Log Text", 70 parameters are used to parameterise the
scaling model for this dataset. A subset of reflections are selected to be used in
scaling model minimisation, which helps to speed up the algorithm (the model is
used to calculate scales for all reflections at the end).
Outlier rejection is performed at several stages, as outliers have a
disproportionately large effect during scaling and can lead to poor scaling results.
During scaling, the distribution of the intensity uncertainties are also
analysed and an error model is optimised to transform the intensity errors
to an expected normal distribution. An error estimate for each scale factor is
also determined based on the covariances of the model parameters.
At the end of the output, a table and summary of the merging statistics are
presented, which give indications of the quality of the scaled dataset.

Inspecting the results
""""""""""""""""""""""

To see what the scaling is telling us about the dataset, plots of the scaling
model should be viewed. These are visible within the "Report View" tab, at the
bottom under "Analysis of scaling model".

.. image:: /figures/process_detail_betalactamase_dui/report_scaling_plots.png

What is immediately apparent is the periodic nature of the scale term, with peaks
and troughs 90° apart. This indicates that the illuminated volume was changing
significantly during the experiment: a reflection would be measured as twice as
intense if it was measured at rotation angle of ~120° compared to at ~210°.
The absorption surface also shows a similar periodicity, as may be expected.
What is less clear is the form of the relative B-factor, which also has a
periodic nature. As a B-factor can be understood to represent radiation damage,
this would not be expected to be periodic, and it is likely that this model
component is accounting for variation that could be described only by a scale
and absorption term. To test this, we can repeat the scaling process but turn
off the :samp:`decay_term`.

To do this in DUI, click "Retry" to set up a new scaling job continuing from
the successful symmetry-determination step. This time, enter the "Advanced" tab
and under `parameterisation` change the value of `decay_term` to `False`. Now
click "Run" to start the job.

             ----------Overall merging statistics (non-anomalous)----------

  Resolution: 69.19 - 1.40

  Observations: 274578

  Unique reflections: 41140

  Redundancy: 6.7

  Completeness: 94.11%

  Mean intensity: 76.6

  Mean I/sigma(I): 16.0

  R-merge: 0.064

  R-meas:  0.070

  R-pim:   0.027


By inspecting the statistics in the output, we can see that removing the decay
term has had the effect of causing around 200 more reflections to be marked as
outliers (taking the outlier count from 0.72% to 0.80% of the data), while
improving some of the R-factors and mean I/sigma(I). Therefore it is probably
best to exclude the decay correction for this dataset. Other options which
could be explored under the "Advanced" tab are the numbers of parameters used
for the various components, for example by changing the :samp:`scale_interval`,
or by adjusting the outlier rejection criterion with a different
:samp:`outlier_zmax`.

Exporting as MTZ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once we are happy with the results from scaling, the data can be exported as
an unmerged mtz file, for further symmetry analysis with pointless_ or to start
structural solution.

To do this, click on the "export" button. This gives the option of an mtz output
name and the option to output scaled intensities. Make sure that box is
ticked otherwise the exported MTZ will only contain intensities from integration.
