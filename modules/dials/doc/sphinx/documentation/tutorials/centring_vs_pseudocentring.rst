DPF3 Part 2: A question of centring
===================================

.. highlight:: none

Introduction
------------

The second part of this tutorial continues from the results obtained in the
:doc:`correcting_poor_initial_geometry_tutorial` tutorial. You should work
through that first to fix the incorrect beam centre recorded in the image
headers and produce a correct indexing solution. Following those steps to the
end, you will have two files:

* :file:`bravais_setting_5.expt` - the experimental geometry including a crystal
  model with a primitive orthorhombic lattice
* :file:`indexed.refl` - the spot list from indexing

Viewing these files using the :program:`dials.image_viewer` and the reciprocal
lattice points in the :program:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer` reveals the
presence of split spots and minor lattices. Nevertheless, these do not cause
great difficulties in processing. More thought is required when considering
the issue of possible pseudocentring. The structure can be solved in more
than one space group. In cases such as this, the true symmetry may not be
known until late stages of refinement. Even then, it might not be completely
clear. Here we will investigate some features of the images that warn us of
the challenges that lie ahead.

If we were to integrate this dataset using the oP solution from the first part
and continue on to the :program:`CCP4` data reduction pipeline, we would see
that :program:`Pointless` chooses the space group :math:`P 2_1 2_1 2_1` but
warns that the ``data were integrated on a primitive lattice, but may belong to
a centered lattice``. Accordingly, :program:`cTruncate` finds strong evidence
for translational NCS, for this basis along a vector of :math:`(0.0, 0.5,
0.5)`. The fact that this vector corresponds to a half integral step along a
face diagonal should lead us to question the space group assignment.

Questioning the lattice symmetry
--------------------------------

It is always good advice to spend some time looking at the images and the
reciprocal lattice before integrating a dataset. If we did so, we may notice the
subtle features in the diffraction pattern that are the cause of the warnings
from :program:`Pointless` and :program:`cTruncate`.

First the reciprocal lattice::

  dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer bravais_setting_5.expt indexed.refl

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_oP_lo_res.png

Here the view has been aligned almost down the long axis of the reciprocal
cell, which is :math:`a^\star` for this choice of basis vectors. We see the
columns of reciprocal lattice points with Miller indices differing by
:math:`h` as lines of closely-spaced points. However, we can also see that
the lengths of the lines alternate between long and short as we move, for
example, in the :math:`c^\star` direction. At this point should suspect a
pseudocentred lattice.

Now the image viewer::

  dials.image_viewer bravais_setting_5.expt indexed.refl

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_oP_im5.png

Here we have zoomed in on a region of the central module on the 5th image. The
line of indexed spots have Miller indices in :math:`(3,-13,l)`. Looking closely
we see that spots with even :math:`l` are systematically weaker than spots with
odd :math:`l`. This fits the theory of a pseudocentred lattice, however we
also see that the spot profile differs between the two sets.

To investigate further we can enforce the centred lattice and see where that
takes us...

.. _section-label-converting-to-centred:

Converting to a centred lattice
-------------------------------

Although :program:`dials.refine_bravais_settings` did not give us a centred
lattice as an option, it is easy to convert the current primitive solution.
First, note that for the currently chosen basis, the centring operation should
be on the A face, not the conventional C face::

  dials.reindex bravais_setting_5.expt space_group=A222

Here is part of the output::

  New crystal:
  Crystal:
      Unit cell: (56.312, 99.662, 121.361, 90.000, 90.000, 90.000)
      Space group: A 2 2 2

We now have a face centred space group, but the indexed reflections still
include those which are now disallowed by the centring operation. An easy
way to fix this is simply to reindex the spot list using the new model. We
also request output of the unindexed reflections to explore later::

  dials.index reindexed.expt strong.refl output.unindexed_reflections=unindexed.refl

This produces a properly indexed spot list, but the space group is in an
unconventional setting. We can fix this as follows::

  dials.refine_bravais_settings indexed.expt indexed.refl

Solution 5 is what we want::

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Solution Metric fit  rmsd  min/max cc #spots lattice                                 unit_cell volume      cb_op

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The table tells us that the indexed spots need a change of basis to be
consistent with the conventional oC lattice::

  dials.reindex indexed.refl change_of_basis_op=b-c,b+c,a

This gives us :file:`reindexed.refl`. Before passing this along with
:file:`bravais_setting_5.expt` to refinement and then to integration it is worth
exploring this result with :program:`dials.image_viewer` and
:program:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer`.

Here is a view of the same region of image 5 as we saw before, but now with only
the spots allowed by centring being indexed:

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_oC_im5.png

Now a view of the reciprocal lattice, aligned down the :math:`c^\star` axis to
show off the systematic absences.

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_oC_lo_res.png

Exploring the unindexed reflections
-----------------------------------

When we indexed with the oC lattice we wrote out the unindexed reflections
as a separate file. We know that the spots in the positions disallowed by the
oC lattice do themselves form an orthorhombic lattice. In views from the
:program:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer` you may also have seen hints of a
third lattice in some parts of reciprocal space. We might try to index these
lattices now::

  dials.index optimised.expt unindexed.refl output.experiments=minor.expt output.reflections=minor.refl unit_cell="99 121 56 90 90 90" space_group=P222 max_lattices=2

Here is some output::

  model 1 (12265 reflections):
  Crystal:
      Unit cell: (100.027, 121.370, 56.258, 90.000, 90.000, 90.000)
      Space group: P 2 2 2

  model 2 (2969 reflections):
  Crystal:
      Unit cell: (99.735, 121.858, 56.487, 90.000, 90.000, 90.000)
      Space group: P 2 2 2

The first lattice is essentially the same as our original primitive solution,
however because we have now excluded all the reflections that were indexed by
the centred lattice, this model now *only* indexes the spots that should be
systematically absent with an oC lattice. The second lattice comes from a
separate crystallite, rotated about 11 degrees from the first and therefore
easily disentangled from the others. We can combine this result with the
previous one::

  dials.combine_experiments bravais_setting_5.expt reindexed.refl minor.expt minor.refl beam=0 detector=0 scan=0 goniometer=0 compare_models=False

Here, the ``beam=0`` etc. specify that the combined result should have all
experimental models apart from the crystal taken from the first experiment,
which is the one described by :file:`bravais_setting_5.expt`. The option
``compare_models=False`` is required in order to force this. The result is
about 65000 indexed reflections, split between three lattices::

  ----------------------
  | Experiment | Nref  |
  ----------------------
  | 0          | 50384 |
  | 1          | 12265 |
  | 2          | 2969  |
  ----------------------

Here is a view of reciprocal space, aligned down the shared :math:`c^\star`
axes of the oC lattice, and its complement, the oP lattice that indexes the
disallowed reflections::

  dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer combined.expt combined.refl

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_3lattices.png

It is worth spending some time with the
:program:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer` at different zoom levels and
orientations, and with different ``Min Z`` and ``Max Z`` limits. See how the
lattice of 'disallowed' reflections is stronger (i.e. more sufficiently strong
spots found) in latter half of the dataset (images 100 onwards).

We can see this more directly if we create an HTML report for the combined
experiments::

  dials.report combined.expt combined.refl

Load the resulting :file:`dials-report.html` in a web browser. This includes
a useful plot of the number of indexed reflections for each lattice versus
the image number. Unfortunately the colours of curves on this plot do not
match the colours in the :program:`dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer`!
Nevertheless, the plot shows how the reflections allowed for the oC lattice
dominate throughout the data collection. The second 'lattice', which
consists only of the reflections of the oP solution that are disallowed by
the oC reflection conditions, is present from the start but becomes more
prominent in the second half of the data collection. The third lattice is a
genuinely separate component, misaligned from the frst by about 11 degrees,
and is present only on images in the first quarter of the dataset.

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_indexed_count_3lattices.png

Intriguingly, the pattern of number of found strong spots for lattice 2
(which roughly corresponds to the intensity of those spots) follows a
sinusoidal pattern, which is weakest around image 60 and strongest around
image 150 (after a 90 degrees rotation of the crystal). Using the image
viewer with the ``Basis vectors`` button ticked you can see how this
corresponds to being weakest when the beam is approximately parallel to the
plane of the pseudocentred C face, and stronger when the beam is orthogonal
to that face, that is when the suggested tNCS vector is orthogonal to the
beam:

.. image:: /figures/dpf3_im60_vs_150.png

Centred or pseudocentred?
-------------------------

We have two ways we can model this crystal:

* Primitive orthorhombic (:math:`P 2_1 2_1 2_1`) with translational NCS
  mimicking centring on the C face
* C-centred orthorhombic (:math:`C 2 2 2_1`), ignoring the systematically weak
  intensities

The purpose of this exercise was mainly to demonstrate the use of DIALS
viewers as diagnostic tools and some of the less commonly used options that
allowed us to isolate the sub-lattice of strong reflections before integration.

If we continued with integration of the :math:`C 2 2 2_1` data and proceeded
onwards to structure solution, model rebuilding and refinement, then we
would have reproduced the structure presented by `PDB entry 5I3L`_. Refinement
of this structure with isotropic B-factors against the :math:`C 2 2 2_1` data
integrated with DIALS results in an R-cryst of 0.18 and an R-free of 0.21.

.. _PDB entry 5I3L: http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=5I3L

On the contrary, if we had chosen the primitive lattice and included the
systematically weak reflections in integration, the structure solution
process would not have been straightforward and the results would be
ambiguous, even if we would have used e.g. chain A of the PDB entry 5I3L as
the search model for molecular replacement. Firstly, there would have been
several different molecular replacement solutions with almost equal scores
and subsequent refinement would favour :math:`P 2_1 2_1 2_1` with a small
margin of only a few percent in R factors compared to other solutions in
space groups  :math:`P 2 2 2_1` and  :math:`P 2_1 2_1 2`. In all these
solutions the pseudo-translation vector relating two dimers would deviate by
no more than 0.2 Angstroms from :math:`(b+c)/2` (this corresponds to the
crystallographic translation :math:`(a+b)/2` in :math:`C 2 2 2_1`). We did
not try to rebuild the :math:`P 2_1 2_1 2_1` solution but instead superposed
two copies of the entire PDB entry 5I3L onto the two dimers forming its
asymmetric unit. We ended up with R-cryst of 0.27 and R-free of 0.29, which
are considerably worse than the values for the :math:`C 2 2 2_1` structure.

There could be several reasons for poor refinement statistics in :math:`P
2_1 2_1 2_1`: the space group assignment was incorrect, the refinement
program had problems with the weak structure amplitudes, or the crystal was
partially disordered or has undergone a phase transition during data
collection and it was not possible in the first place to describe the weak
reflections with a single crystal structure. In any case, the 'thorough'
:math:`P 2_1 2_1 2_1` model gives no improvement in density or refinement
statistics and provides no new structural information and we conclude that
it should not be used for structural analysis. Ultimately it is true that
for a real crystal any space group assignment is only an approximation.

Conclusions
-----------

* Diffraction data may display a sub-lattice of weak spots (pseudocentring)
  indicating pseudo-translation in the crystal structure and, possibly, some
  degree of crystal disorder.
* In many cases the weak reflections are not as weak as in this example and
  their intensities grow or oscillate with resolution. In those cases, good
  maps and refinement statistics can only be obtained by refinement against
  all the available data. It is important then to make sure that indexing
  picks up all the spots, strong and weak.
* In many other cases, similar to the current example, the weak spots have no
  practical meaning and should be excluded. Ideally this should be done
  before the integration, which we did here in the section
  :ref:`section-label-converting-to-centred`.
* Use the DIALS viewers to make sure you know what to expect from your data!
