reflection tables now behave more like python dictionaries

Methods .keys() and .items() return iterators for the keys and item
tuples respectively. Using the reflection table in an iterator context
is now equivalent to .keys() rather than .rows().

Attempting to access unknown keys raises a KeyError instead of a
RuntimeError
