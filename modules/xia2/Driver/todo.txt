To Do:

24/MAY/06

Figure out a straightforward way to record the commands which come in and
the records which come out from the standard output. This will probably best
be done by splitting input/output into pairs of methods - _input/_output
which is overloaded by the Driver implementation and input/output which
the clients use, which has the recording functionality build in.

This is probably the only way to do this - a Decorator probably won't work!
No - definately won't work, because I don't know the initial method name
to pass the call on to if it's overloaded.

30/MAY/06

This is what I have implemented.

Driver API specifies call input() -> this is recorded then delegated to the
Driver implementation _input() method. Simple. This means that the _input()
method must be overloaded - not input()!

19/JUN/06

Implement a ClusterDriverFactory which will create a ClusterDriver instance
(to the client looks like a Driver) if "cluster" is in XIA2CORE_DRIVERTYPE.
Can be specific like "cluster.sge".
